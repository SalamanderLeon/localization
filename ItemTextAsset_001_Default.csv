Junk_2x1_W_Icon_001_Desc,"Planks that are composited from several different plant life. Titan isn't much of a forest, so it seems that the people here tried to make these planks out of whatever flora they could find."
Junk_1x2_MA_Icon_001_Desc,"A small piece of machinery. Its shape suggests that it's a part of a much larger whole, and the wiring seems excessive for a basic appliance. Could this be part of an automaton?"
Junk_1x1_E_Icon_001_Desc,"An old radio. It's rusty, falling apart, and most of the wiring is exposed or severed."
Junk_1x1_E_Icon_002_Desc,"Some sort of handheld device, possibly a dedicated calculator. Regardless, it's been trampled on and can't do anything anymore."
Junk_1x1_E_Icon_003_Desc,"A handheld radio. At a glance, it looks relatively untouched, but none of the buttons do anything, so it should probably go to the recycler."
Junk_1x1_E_Icon_004_Desc,An old-fashioned camera. How odd that one of these would be on Titan. One of the camp people must enjoy old photography.
Junk_1x1_E_Icon_005_Desc,"A very old handheld video game device. Even if it wasn't broken, the batteries are probably dead, and batteries are rare to come across these days."
Junk_1x1_E_Icon_006_Desc,"A device that is mostly screen, so it was probably a monitor or touch device of some sort. Either way, the screen is cracked and nonfunctional."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_001_Desc,This blender got really abused. One can only imagine what it was blending when it became like this.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_002_Desc,An extremely grimy and nonfunctioning toaster. Maybe someone tried putting toast in it instead of bread.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_003_Desc,"A mostly destroyed hand mixer. With how desperate the current camp is with supplies, having a hand mixer feels like a luxury."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_004_Desc,"Some sort of cutter, possibly for deli meat or something like that. It's too dull and stationary now, though."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_005_Desc,"A kitchen appliance of some kind, maybe for compressing stuff. Regardless, it's going to get compressed itself soon."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_006_Desc,"This appears to be a battery or power pack for a large yet portable device. It's clearly aged, so any battery it may have had is likely gone already."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_007_Desc,A decrepit grass cutter. It's weird that this is here... Maybe someone was really optimistic about the whole terraforming plan.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_008_Desc,"I'm hardly an engineer, but this looks like part of an engine. No idea what the engine would go to, but this component seems inoperable, anyway. I'm sure Judith can make sense (or materials) out of it."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_009_Desc,No idea what this is. It doesn't matter too much considering it's only good for recycling now.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_010_Desc,"A pretty small handheld drill. At least, it was a drill before the tip was completely torn off."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_011_Desc,"It seems to be some sort of device, but it won't do anything anymore, so it's only good for recycling now."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_013_Desc,One of those syringes with a neat ergonomic handle.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_014_Desc,"An old saw with a rusty, dull blade that would probably sooner tear something apart before it ever gets cut."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_015_Desc,"A relatively intact microscope. The camp should already have one, if it needs one at all, so this should probably just be recycled for now."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_020_Desc,"A beat-up pump, probably for air or some other gas. This might have been useful for refilling the oxygen canisters, but of course it's damaged beyond repair."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_021_Desc,An old-fashioned electric drill. Very damaged and inoperational and eligible for being recycled into machinery materials.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_022_Desc,"A workshop clamp. It could maybe still work in its condition, but I don't think there's a workshop in the camp, anyway."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_023_Desc,"A small, handheld, portable vacuum. Maybe the trash that it sucked up will provide some extra material."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_024_Desc,A broken hair dryer. Very useless outside of the recycler.
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_025_Desc,"A very broken robot vacuum. It would be overworked with the current state of the camp, anyway."
Junk_1x1_MA_Icon_026_Desc,A small drone that's been roughed up too much. It would be a miracle if it could move at all anymore.
